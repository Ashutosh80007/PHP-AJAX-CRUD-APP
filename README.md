# PHP AJAX CRUD App 🛠️

This is a simple yet functional **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** application built using **PHP**, **AJAX**, **jQuery**, **Bootstrap**, and **MySQL**. It demonstrates how to interact with a database without reloading the page using AJAX and modals.

- View all user records in a dynamic Bootstrap table
- Edit existing records with a modal popup
- Delete individual records with confirmation
- Delete all records at once
- All operations are performed asynchronously using AJAX

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
https://github.com/Ashutosh80007/PHP-AJAX-CRUD-APP

2. Import the SQL file into your MySQL database

Create a database (e.g., crud)

Create a user table with appropriate fields (or share your .sql file for me to write it for you!)

3. Set Up Database Connection

In ajax-crud/fitech.php, update your database credentials:
$connect = new mysqli("localhost", "root", "", "crud");

4. Run the App

Open index.php in your browser using your local server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP).
